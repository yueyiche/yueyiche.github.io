As a graduate student instructor and teaching assistant, I've contributed to courses such as:

- Earth System Science fundamentals
- Climate and global change
- Scientific programming for geoscientists

I'm also involved in mentoring undergraduate research projects and providing peer support for new teaching assistants.
