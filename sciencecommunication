Iâ€™m passionate about making science accessible and engaging for all audiences.

Some of my recent science communication efforts include:

- Public talks and workshops on climate science
- Writing articles and blog posts for non-specialist audiences
- Participating in community outreach events and open house programs

More examples and links will be added soon!
