Iâ€™m passionate about making science accessible and engaging for all audiences.

Some of my recent science communication efforts include:

- Creating zines and illustrations for science projects
- Public talks and workshops on glaciers and sea ice
- Writing articles and blog posts for non-specialist audiences

More examples and links will be added soon!
