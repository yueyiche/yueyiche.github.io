I'm Yueyi Che, a PhD student in Earth System Science at the University of California, Irvine.

My current research focuses on how glaciers and ocean interact, how ice melts and how sea level changes under climate change, using tools from data science, modeling, and remote sensing.

### Here is my bio:

Yueyi Che is a PhD student at the Earth System Science department at the University of California, Irvine. Yueyi received her Master of Science degree in Earth and Planetary Science and the Stanford Graduate Fellowship at Stanford University in the Doerr School of Sustainability. Yueyi received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in Geology with a Climate Science minor, as the department valedictorian.

During her time at Cal, Yueyi held a role as a student sample preparation technician in Berkeley Geochronology Center. She also participated the 2-month-long Juneau Icefield Research Program to study glaciers in Alaska and Canada in the field. Yueyi conducted her honor thesis on the deglaciation history in Yosemite using cosmogenic Be10 and C14 exposure ages. She also participates the Fung Fellowship program at Berkeley to study conservation and technology.

At Stanford, Yueyi continues her passion for glaciers and has been exploring different research methods and ideas to study glaciers, from chemistry lab work, field work, to data analysis. Yueyi conducted field work at Eliot Glacier on Mt. Hood, as well as a sampling trip to the Antarctica Peninsula on a Lindblad Expeditions - National Geographic cruise. Yueyi's MS thesis focuses on snow's thermodynamic effects on sea ice in Antarctica using modeling and data analysis.

At UC Irvine, Yueyi is excited to continue researching glaciers in Antarctica and study how ice sheet interacts with ocean. For her future career, Yueyi hopes to become a professor who does research on glaciers to aid the world leaders to adapt to global warming.
