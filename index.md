Welcome to my personal website! I'm Yueyi Che, a PhD student in Earth System Science department at the University of California Irvine. I use this site to share my research, science communication efforts, and teaching experience.

The cover photo is my favorite photo I have ever taken. It was taken when I was doing field work in Antarctica in Dec 2023 with Lindblad Expedition - National Geographic. We hiked up a snowy slope and these chinstrap penguins were so zen in the snow. I aimed my phone camera through my binoculars to capture this cute penguin. Every time I look at this photo, I breathe the cold brisk air that day again.
